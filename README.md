# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:

To identify user pain points, write clear UX problem statements, choose appropriate research methods, and create user personas for two apps to produce a ready-to-submit UX lab report.

## Algorithm:

1.Select scenarios choose the two apps: Food delivery and Travel app.

2.Gather initial observations review screenshots and jot common user complaints (form confusion, long login).

3.Identify pain points list concrete user problems for each scenario.

4.Write problem statements use the template: "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

5.Choose research methods pick methods per scenario (e.g., interviews, usability testing, surveys, A/B testing) and write brief justifications.

6.Create personas craft at least two personas (demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, motivation) representing typical users.

7.Prepare deliverables compile content into a PDF lab report and add images; create a GitHub repo and upload the PDF.

8.Summarize outputs list files, repo URL, and a short conclusion for submission.

📌 Scenario 1: Food Delivery App – “FoodGo”
1. Identifying & Writing Problem Statements
User Pain Points

Users struggle to quickly find food options that match their taste/diet.

Long delivery times and unclear ETA make users frustrated.

Tracking orders is confusing during peak hours.

Checkout process feels lengthy or complicated.

Problem Statements (Template Based)

1️⃣ “A busy user needs a way to quickly discover food options because exploring menus takes too long, which results in delayed ordering and frustration.”

2️⃣ “A user needs a way to track their delivery in real-time because current updates are unclear, which results in anxiety and repeated checking.”

2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods
Recommended Methods & Justifications

🔹 Surveys
To gather broad data about ordering habits, pain points, delivery expectations.

🔹 User Interviews
To understand deeper motivations—why users choose certain restaurants, what frustrates them about waiting times.

🔹 Usability Testing (Prototype Test)
To test whether users easily navigate food categories, cart, checkout, and tracking UI.

🔹 Field Observation (Optional)
Observing food pickup/delivery process can reveal logistical issues affecting UX.

User Pain Points

Users find it difficult to compare prices across buses, trains, and flights.

Travel details (timings, seat availability, documents) are not always clear.

Long forms during booking cause drop-offs.

Users struggle to manage tickets and ID proofs.

Problem Statements (Template Based)

1️⃣ “A budget traveler needs a way to compare travel options because prices vary widely across services, which results in overspending or spending extra time searching.”

2️⃣ “A frequent traveler needs a way to store travel documents in one place because switching between apps is inconvenient, which results in missed bookings and delays.”

2. Identifying Appropriate Research Methods
Recommended Methods & Justifications

🔹 User Interviews

🔹 Competitor Analysis
To identify gaps in existing apps (e.g., MakeMyTrip, RedBus).

🔹 Usability Testing
